License
Single Application License
The Single Application License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.
You are licensed to use the Item to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”).
An End Product is one of the following things, both requiring an application of skill and effort.
The End Product is a customised implementation of the Item.
The End Product is a work that incorporates the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and different in nature than the Item.
You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.
You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.
You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client.
You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications.
For example: You can’t purchase an item, convert it to another item and sell or give it to more than one client. You can’t license an item and then make it available as-is on your website for your users to download.
You can’t use the Item in any application allowing an end user to customise a digital or physical product to their specific needs, such as an “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” application. You can use the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Item that is created using the application.
You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.
You can only use the Item for lawful purposes.
This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

Multiple Applications License
The Multiple Applications License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.
